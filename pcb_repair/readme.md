# A section of the board is not responding!

This is most likely caused by the solder joints of the resistor array disconnected from the PCB due to the crazy amount of board flex on this awefully long board without any solid support from behind.

#### To troubleshoot:

1. Turn the board upside down

2. Connect it to your PC with the tester program open

3. you should see which section of the touch pads aren't working

4. Press down (Apply pressure) onto the resistor array and see if it works again

5. If yes, congrats, just reflow that particular resistor array with a soldering iron (remember to use flux) and you're good to go!

Apparently the fix is the same as above.
