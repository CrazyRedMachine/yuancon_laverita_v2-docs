Main MCU is a STM32F103C8T6, firmware is ZIOS, Zhousensor's propriety firmware.
Said to have write protect, all content will be wiped if tampered, if you wanna trust his word.

Touch chips have their markings stratched off. (SOP20?)

Air tower's MCU also has its markings stratched off, but its safe to assume its just works as an ADC.
I have written a test sketch for arduino to emulate interfacing with the main MCU.
